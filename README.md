This assignment aims at building on what we have seen in assignment 2, where we navigated
through list-like objects, to start working with non-linear data structures. In this assignment,
you will implement a derivative of a Binary Search Tree and execute several methods that iterate
through trees. The objective is to familiarize yourself with the implementation of this Abstract
data type, probably the most discussed one in the course. More specifically, you will be applying
concepts seen through the in-class discussion of recursion, trees and how to navigate them, and
binary search trees, as well as some principles we will formalize when we discuss heaps.
